## 🧠 **ADHD-FRIENDLY DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES**

### **🎯 Design Philosophy**
When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

#### **✅ DO:**
- **Quick visual feedback** - Every interaction should respond instantly
- **Clear progress indicators** - Users should always know where they are
- **Chunked information** - Break complex ideas into bite-sized pieces  
- **High contrast visuals** - Make text and UI elements easy to read
- **Satisfying micro-rewards** - Celebrate small wins with animations
- **Consistent patterns** - Don't make users relearn interactions

#### **❌ AVOID:**
- **Long walls of text** - Break it up with headings and visuals
- **Delayed feedback** - Interactions should feel instant
- **Hidden progress** - Always show advancement clearly
- **Overwhelming layouts** - Keep visual hierarchy simple
- **Inconsistent behaviors** - Same actions should do same things
- **Distracting animations** - Effects should enhance, not distract
